Thinking about writing my first blog post at the Flatiron School really had me in a rut. Even now, as I sit here typing this, the timer of it's due date ticks down steadily - less than 24 hours left to submit my thoughts in writing. Why did I wait for so long? It's not as if I didn't know of the deadline far in advance of the actual date. Surely it would be far less stressful had I just started working on something weeks ago. What am I afraid of? Surely you can tell by the title of this post that the answer to that question, when I really sat down and reflected on it, was failure. 

Failure is the simple answer, but I had many other thoughts before that simple conclusion. What could I have to say, as a complete neophyte in this field, that so many before me haven't said? What insight could I provide this isn't already documented all over the internet by others far more skilled and far more knowledgeable than myself? More importantly, what if I'm wrong? What if I don't actually know what I'm talking about? 

If you are reading this as someone in a similar position, newly embarking on your own journey to learn code, you may relate to this feeling. I even have an inkling that most experienced programmers feel this way sometimes, or at least have at some point in their careers. I recognize the irony that this post flies right in the face of those questions I was asking myself. I am certainly not providing insight on something that has yet to be documented, and I really don't know if I'm completely off the mark. My take away, and the reason I decided to make this post, is that I think thats the point. 

The only thing I know is that this experience is real to me, in the moment, and if that is true it is certainly real for others as well.

One of the most important things I have been learning in the short time I have been at Flatiron so far is the importance of failure. It is something that is brought up as one of our first pieces of advice: "Embrace the stuck". It makes sense, there is far more to be gained from making mistakes than from succeeding the first time every time. It doesn't make failing at something any less frustrating though, does it?

As children we were bad at pretty much everything we tried to do, but this is expected. Children are just learning how the world works, and mistakes are the primary vehicle by which we learn to do better. As an adult; however, this method of learning is slowly worked out of you. We are not afforded the opportunity to be bad at things. A culture of striving for perfection takes hold, and suddenly the fear of failure stops us from even attempting difficult things. How do we learn, grow, and develop new skills with this fear immobilizing us from even taking the first step?

As I work through my course work here I have been trying to re-frame my thinking to embrace that fear. I found that if you embrace failure as an eventuality, if you can expect it as an outcome instead of a nasty trait to avoid, you can equip yourself with the tools necessary to overcome that hurdle. With those tools in hand, you become capable of tackling the problem head on. The fear and anxiety of tripping over those proverbial hurdles, the immobilizing avoidance of a problem, is replaced with the confidence to move over them and forward to the next one.

As programmers we never stop learning. There will always be new languages, frameworks, technologies, etc. Some times, this can seem daunting. Especially so for those of us new to the field - it can sometimes feel like a sisyphean effort, and in some ways I'm beginning to learn that it is. My conclusion though, is that it doesn't really matter. If you can allow yourself to be child-like in your learning, if you can learn the skill of learning how to fail, you equip yourself with the tools to tackle any problem that you might come across. 

After all, what is programming if not learning how to solve new problems every day?
